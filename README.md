# Final Project
Topic
Alcohol and car accidents 

Domain of Interest
1. We are interested in this field/domain because many of us have friends who have been impacted by car accidents caused by driving under the influence. In addition, according to National Public Radio (NPR), alcohol consumption has been increasing in the United States, and many people believe that this may be related to the frequency of car accidents. 


2.  Other Data- Driven Projects
Cdc’s Annual Self-reported Alcohol-impaired Driving Episodes among U.S. Adults, 1993–2014(Leila)
Link: https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/impaired_driving/impaired-drv_factsheet.html
Description: This website collected and presented state-specific data on drunk driving and fatal car accidents, including age and gender specific death rate. 
Question: Is there a correlation between drunk driving and fatal car accidents in the United States?
How the Question Can be Answered Using Data:The dataset showed states, such as MT and ND, with a high percentage of adults who report driving after drinking too much with in the past 30 days, and a high percentage of fatal car accidents with BAC => 0.08%, which suggest a positive correlation between drunk driving and fatal car accidents. But it also showed states, such as MS with a low percentage of report drunk driving and a relatively high percentage death rate; as well as states like WA with relatively high rate of self reported drunk driving and low death rate. 
Drunk driving rate falls to new low, federal data shows (Leila) 
Link: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/30/drunken-driving-rate-falls-to-new-low-federal-data-show/?utm_term=.68942ceebc17
Description: The dataset showed the trend of driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs from 2002 to 2014, among people aged 16 and older. As well as the correlation between age and driving under the influence. 
Question: What is the trend of driving under the influence of alcohol by age group in the United States?
How the Question Can be Answered Using Data: The dataset showed that overall driving under the influence of alcohol has decreased from 15.3% to 11.1%. While drivers aged 16 to 25 has decreased dramatically, over 10 percent, drivers aged 26 and older only decreased less than 3 percent. 
MADD (Anna) 
Link: https://www.madd.org/statistics/
Description: MADD focuses on working towards eliminating any drunk driving incidents. They also want to raise awareness to others and help spread the message to eliminate any potential incidents. The website has multiple interactive statistics and visualizations that help highlight the dangers of the issue and give solutions on what the next step could be.
Question: How do the different laws and regulations in each state affect the number of accidents? 
How the Question Can be Answered Using Data:
Use the data from the website to showcase the number of laws to show the correlation between regulations and the number of accidents. Also can show trends from year to year that can show the impact of laws as the government changes. 
Drunk Driving by the Numbers (Anna)
Link: https://www.bts.gov/archive/publications/by_the_numbers/drunk_driving/index
Description: The Bureau of Transportation Statistics gathers data on drunk driving numbers. They mostly visualize the comparisons of drunk driving and non-drunk driving incidents to show the impact intoxication. 
Question: What is the rate of fatalities due to drunk driving accidents vs all other fatalities?
How can the question be answered using the data: 
We can pull the data from the website to show the total number of deaths per year in the United States due to all causes. Then we can pull the individual categories of causes of death to showcase how high or low the deaths due to car accidents are. 


Questions
What is the correlation between alcohol and car accidents in the United States?
We would want to look at data about the total number of crashes in the United States, maybe by state or region, and compare that to data about car accidents involving alcohol for that same state/region.
What percentage of alcohol-related car accidents are caused by drivers under the legal drinking age?
This could be answered by looking at data which shows the age of the drivers who caused car crashes, and comparing to see which drivers were underage (15-20 years old) and under the influence of alcohol.  
Is a driver with higher blood alcohol concentration (BAC) more likely to be involved in a crash?
We would expect that drivers with higher BAC are more likely to be involved in a crash. We can compare the percentage of drivers in crashes, with BAC less than the U.S. legal limit of 0.8, to the percentage of drivers in crashes who were over the legal limit.
Which areas in the United States had the the most amount of fatalities based on BAC in 2016?
We can answer this question by looking at different states in the United States and looking for the maximum amount of fatalities. 
Does either binge drinking or underage drinking lead to a higher consumption cost in the productivity area?
This question can be answered by looking at whether binge drinking or underage drinking leads to a higher cost in productivity due to this consumption. 

Finding Data
https://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/States/StatesAlcohol.aspx (Wen Yi)
Download the data into the project repo in a data/ folder (1 point)?
Description of how was the data collected or generated (1 point)?
This data was collected by Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), published by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, up to the year 2017.  FARS is a U.S. census that contains data on all vehicle crashes that occur on a public roadway and involve a fatality. Instead of counting and classifying all crashes that occur, a sample of crash data is collected. These data are provided voluntarily and anonymously.
How many observations (rows) and features (columns) are in your data(1 point)?
There are multiple tables under this link but each table on this page has 52 rows (50 states and Washington D.C., plus 1 for the total). One table that we may want to use is “Drivers Involved in Fatal Crashes, by State and Blood Alcohol Concentration of the Driver”, which has 11 columns.
What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset(1 point)?
This dataset could help examine the question, “Is a driver with higher blood alcohol concentration (BAC) more likely to be involved in a crash?” because it clearly shows how the level of alcohol the driver has consumed, whether none, some but under the legal limit, and over the limit. 


2. Motor Vehicle Traffic Fatalities, by State and Highest Driver BAC in the Crash, 2016
https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812450 (Lisa Marie)

Download the data into the project repo in a data/ folder (1 point)?
Description of how was the data collected or generated (1 point)?
This data was collected by the US Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This is information on fatal motor vehicle crashes and fatalities based on data from FARS. FARS is a census of fatal crashes in the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. 
How many observations (rows) and features (columns) are in your data(1 point)?
This link leads to several data tables, although the one we are focusing on is the one about “Motor Vehicle Traffic Fatalities, by State and Highest Driver BAC in the Crash, 2016” There are 52 rows in the data set(plus one more for the total in the US), and 10 columns. 
What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset(1 point)?
This dataset can help gain a concentrated insight into each individual state’s information about the total number of fatalities, and the highest driver Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) in the crash. Using this information, we can answer the question, “Which areas had the the most amount of fatalities based on BAC in 2016?”


3. Excessive Alcohol Consumption Costs (in Millions), by Category, U.S., 2010
(https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/data-stats.htm)- Lisa Marie
Download the data into the project repo in a data/ folder (1 point)?
Description of how was the data collected or generated (1 point)?
This data was presented by the Center of Disease Control and Prevention. From March 2012 to March 2014, the 26 cost components used to assess the cost of excessive drinking in 2006 were projected to 2010 based on incidence. These 26 cost components include lost productivity, health care, criminal justice, components that have been researched to be directly attributed to excessive drinking. Estimates of the cost to government and costs due to binge drinking, underage drinking, and drinking during pregnancy were calculated nationally and allocated to states.
How many observations (rows) and features (columns) are in your data(1 point)?
There are 30 rows and 6 columns in the data. 
What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset(1 point)?
If excessive drinking were to decrease, which categories of cost would be driven down by the largest overall percentage?
Does either binge drinking or underage drinking lead to a higher consumption cost in the productivity area?
