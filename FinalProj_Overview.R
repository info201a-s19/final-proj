"The act of driving under the influence(DUI) involved operating a vehicle while
one has a blood alcohol tolerance of at least .08. This action is one that an 
abundance of people often overlook until it is too late. In many sitautions,
people are unaware that their BAC leve is already .08 or that they are too
intoxicated to keep driving. This is due to the effects of alcohol, and the lack
of obvious indicators it holds to make it clear to an invididual that they are
not conscious enough to operate a vehicle. 
  The affects of DUI can range from those that are minor, all the way to extreme
fatalities that cannot be undone. By observing real data that depicts possible 
correlations between DUI and fatalities, a variety of important questions can be 
answered and potentially help a large audience gain a better understanding of 
the effects of driving under the influence.

  The specific data we will be using for this report includes BAC levels
for each state along with the number of fatalities, impaired driving
death rate, percentage of adults who have died from DUI's in specific states, 
overall collision statistics, 
With all of these data sources, our report aims to answer the specific questions 
of:

1.Is a driver with higher blood alcohol concentration (BAC) more likely to be 
involved in a crash?
2.What is the percentage of adults involved in car accidents at the BAC levels 
of 0, 0.1-0.7, 0.8+ respectively? These accidents will be compared at different 
BAC levels for various states. 
3.
