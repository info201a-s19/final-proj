3 Major Takeaways

"1)
As can be seen from the data presented in various states in the US, having a BAC 
of over 0.8, which also characterizes one as having a DUI is strongly correlated 
with car accident injuries and fatalities. From real life examples from the 
states of ___ and ____specifically, one can see 
that the largest percentage of car accidents occur from those that are either 
unrelated to alcohol, or ones that have a BAC level of over 0.8. This is 
important to raise awareness for because of how incredibly easy it is to reach 
this BAC level without one even realizing it. Thus, people should try to avoid 
drinking and driving at all costs if possible. 

2) 
One of the ways to examine whether a driver with higher blood 
alcohol concentration (BAC) more likely to be involved in a crash is by 
comparing the percentage of drivers with 0.01-0.07 BAC versus those with 0.08+ 
BAC. By looking at the percentage values, we see a general trend that the 
percentage of drivers who were over the limit in fatal crashes is always greater 
than the percentage of those intoxicated but under the limit
